Strength.js
===========

Simple word count strength plugin for a textarea or input field. Forked from Strength.js (password validator).

### Documentation

#### ..:: Getting Started

##### Include the relevant files

Firstly include jQuery and the strength.css and strength.js files. Place these before `&lt;/head&gt;` section

    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="strength.js"></script>

##### Create a field you want to validate for word count

This expects the element to not have an id as it will be reset in the plugin.
    <textarea id="myTextArea"></textarea>

##### Initiate the plugin

Once you have created your field you will need to initiate the plugin.

At its most basic level you can initiate the plugin like:

    $(document).ready(function ($) {
        $("#myTextArea").strength();

    });

If you want to initiate the plugin with options then you can do so like:

    $('#myTextArea').strength({
        strengthClass: 'strength',
        strengthMeterClass: 'strength_meter',
        threshHolds: [5, 10, 15],
        unique: false
    });

#### ..:: Options

    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Variable</th>
            <th>Default Value</th>
            <th>Description</th>
